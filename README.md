# ColorFlipper

This ColorFlipper uses basic JavaScript, CSS and HTML tools.

-> The webpage contains two links : Simple and Hex

-> The simple page allows us to flip about a finite number of colours, that I have added in an array.

-> On the other hand, the hex page allows flipping between infinite colours as the randomness is based on the permutation of 6 characters or numbers.

This project is aimed to learn JavaScript basics.

The project has been published using GitHub at: https://maithri-3.github.io/ColorFlipper/
